# Banking Crisis and Inflation Cycles

## Data modelling of financial crisis recovery
This repository aims to provide empirical evidence to the paper "Information Cycles and Depression in a Stochastic Money-in-Utility Model" from Horii, Ryo and Ono, Yoshiyasu from ISER, Osaka University.

We aim to estimate the average response of macroeconomic variables to banking crisis of different durations, as well as the average pattern of the recovery period.
